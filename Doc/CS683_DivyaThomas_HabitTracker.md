# CS683 Project Assignment - Habit Tracker
### By Divya Thomas

--
## 1. Overview
In this day and age, people are busy. It's hard to stick to a routine and develop good habits while surrounded by distractions and long to-do lists. Since good habits are so important and beneficial to your overall wellbeing and everyday life, Habit Tracker is an organized consistent tool that can be used to keep people on track, especially those like me who LOVE to stay organized, keep lists, and track their progress. 

This is an application that allows users to plan out their daily habits and moods, with reminders and the ability to check thier consistency over time.

## 2. Related Work

My main inspiration for this application is the "Routines" iOS application by Care/Of. I use this application daily to track my morning and night routines. 

As someone who gets easily distracted by my phone in the morning or other priorities, this application has helped me tremendously in developing good, consistent habits that set me up for success. I have never felt more organized and accomplished than after I started using this application.

While the "Routines" application is strictly for morning and evening routines, rather than general habits. It allows users to set up and list customized steps to thier routines, and check them off as they go about their days. The application also provides reflection questions in which the user can assess their mental health and periodically encourages them when they have completed a consistent streak of completing particuar tasks over a course of time. At the end of the week, the user is able to find a detailed progress report connecting their reflections/moods with te consistency of thier completion of tasks in their routines.

I envision the Habit Tracker to e similar to this application in that it shows a list of custom items for the user to be able to check off as their days progress. I want this to also track trends and provide some sort of report and analysis of the user's progress.
